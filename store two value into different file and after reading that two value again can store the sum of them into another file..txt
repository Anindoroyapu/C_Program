int a,b;
sherlock=fopen("Sourav.cpp","w");
fprintf(sherlock,"%d",20);
watson=fopen("Marry.cpp","w");
fprintf(watson,"%d",10);
fclose(sherlock);
fclose(watson);
sherlock=fopen("Sourav.cpp","r");
fscanf(sherlock,"%d",&a);
watson=fopen("Marry.cpp","r");
fprintf(watson,"%d",&b);
adler=fopen("Result.cpp","w");
fprintf(adler,"%d",a+b);
getch();
